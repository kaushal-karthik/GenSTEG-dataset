This repository provides a publicly accessible dataset of inputs and outputs generated by the
GenSTEG encryption framework. 

The dataset contains: **1000 plaintext → ciphertext pairs**  

All samples were produced using the same undisclosed seed to emulate a fixed session
encryption setting. The plaintext corpus is derived from public-domain English text
(Project Gutenberg),containing diverse symbols, punctuation, and variable-length
phrases.

This dataset is released to support independent analysis, cryptanalytic evaluation, and strength testing.

## Column-wise Description

The dataset is provided as a CSV file with the following columns:

- **id**  
  A unique identifier for each sample (1–1000).  
  This is included for easy indexing and reproducibility.

- **plaintext**  
  The original input message vector.
  Phrase extracted from the public-domain Sherlock Holmes corpus (Project Gutenberg).  
  The text includes natural punctuation, spacing, capitalization, numbers, and variable-length phrasing.

- **ciphertext**  
  The corresponding encrypted text generated by the GenSTEG trinary-based encryption pipeline under a fixed, undisclosed seed.  
  Each ciphertext is the final output of the full substitute–permute–substitute process (LUT → OERT → RLUT).

- **length**
  The length of the message vector
